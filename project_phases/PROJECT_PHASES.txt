# 1. Data Preparation & Cleaning

  Loaded dataset.

  Checked descriptive stats (df.describe(), df.info()).

  Verified class distribution (no empty classes).

  Converted CCAvg (Credit Card Avg) from string → float.

  Dropped ID (unique) and Zip Code (all same).

  Binned Age into categorical groups of 10s.

  Renamed Income and Mortgage to represent thousands.

  Converted categorical vars:

  Education: {1=Undergrad, 2=Graduate, 3=Advanced}

  Personal Loan, Securities Account, CD Account, Online, CreditCard: {0=No, 1=Yes}

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  Plotted continuous variables: histograms, boxplots.

  Plotted categorical variables: count plots.

  Correlation analysis:

  Correlation matrix (df.corr()), heatmap.

  Bivariate plots: Income, Experience, Mortgage, CC Avg vs Loan Acceptance.

  Chi-Square test: associations between categorical vars and Personal Loan.

  Welch’s t-test: income difference between acceptors vs non-acceptors (p ≪ 0.001).

## Observations:

  Loan acceptors tend to have higher income (100k–200k).

  Education, Family size, and CD account show association with loan acceptance.

  Online banking / credit card usage less predictive.

# 3. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

  Encoded categorical features.

  Train/test split (80/20).

  StandardScaler applied for Logistic Regression (not needed for tree-based).

# 4. Model Training & Evaluation

  Models trained:

    Logistic Regression (baseline).

    Random Forest (non-linear).

    XGBoost (boosted trees).

  Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix.

  Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV.

# 5. Model Interpretation

  Logistic Regression: coefficient/odds ratio interpretation.

  Random Forest & XGBoost: built-in feature importance.

  Permutation feature importance.

  SHAP values for local + global explanations.

# 6. Key Findings

  Strong Predictors: Income, Education (Graduate/Advanced), Family size (3–4), CD Account.

  Weak Predictors: Family=2, Online, CreditCard usage.

Business Implications:

  Higher education → much higher acceptance (~45–50× vs undergrad).

  Families with 3–4 more likely to accept than singles.

  CD Account holders are ~13× more likely to accept (cross-sell opportunity).

  Income steadily increases acceptance likelihood.

# 7. Conclusion

  Best performing model: [insert best one, e.g., XGBoost].

  Top features: Income, Education, Family, CD Account.

  Dataset limitations: size, missing variables.

# 8. Future Work

  Pipelines & ColumnTransformers (scikit-learn).

  Save models with joblib/pickle.

  Requirements management (requirements.txt / environment.yml).

  Deploy with FastAPI (predict endpoint).

  SHAP integration in production.

  Dockerize for deployment.
