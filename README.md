### **Author:** Sanskar Bajimaya  
### **Project Type:** Business Intelligence & Predictive Analytics  
### **Domain:** Banking / Financial Services  



## **1. Executive Summary**

The **Bank Personal Loan Campaign Analysis** project aims to help financial institutions **identify potential customers most likely to accept personal loan offers**.  
By combining **data-driven insights** with **machine learning models**, the project demonstrates how banks can **reduce marketing costs**, **increase conversion rates**, and **target high-value customers effectively**.

| **Objective** | **Business Outcome** |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Identify characteristics of customers who are likely to accept loans | Enables targeted marketing strategies |
| Predict customer likelihood using machine learning | Improves campaign efficiency and ROI |
| Interpret model insights for decision-making | Guides product, pricing, and outreach strategies |



## **2. Business Context**

Traditional marketing campaigns often reach large audiences but yield **low conversion rates**.  
This analysis provides a **data-backed approach** to segmenting and prioritizing customers, helping the bank focus resources on those **most likely to respond positively**.

### **Key Business Questions**
1. What customer characteristics increase the likelihood of loan acceptance?  
2. How can predictive analytics improve campaign targeting and ROI?  
3. Which model offers the most reliable performance for operational use?



## **3. Data Overview**

**Dataset:** Bank Customer Marketing Data  
**Records:** ~5,000 customers  
**Variables:** 14 (demographic, financial, behavioral)  

| **Variable Category** | **Examples** | **Business Meaning** |
|------------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Demographics | Age, Family, Education | Customer profile |
| Financial | Income, Mortgage | Financial capability |
| Behavioral | Credit Card Avg. (CCAvg), CD Account, Online Banking | Engagement indicators |
| Target | Personal Loan (0 = No, 1 = Yes) | Loan acceptance outcome |



## **4. Analytical Approach**

The project followed a structured, end-to-end **data science process** designed to align technical modeling with business outcomes.

| **Phase** | **Business Objective** | **Analytical Approach** |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **EDA** | Understand customer segments | Descriptive analysis, visual trends |
| **Feature Engineering** | Improve prediction accuracy | Transform & encode key variables |
| **Modeling** | Predict high-probability customers | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost |
| **Evaluation** | Assess reliability | Accuracy, Recall, AUC-ROC |
| **Interpretation** | Translate model insights to action | SHAP, Feature Importance |
| **Recommendation** | Support business decision-making | Segment prioritization, campaign design |



## **5. Key Insights & Findings**

| **Insight** | **Business Interpretation** |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Customers with **higher income (>$100K)** show higher loan acceptance | Indicates strong financial capability & repayment confidence |
| **Graduate/Advanced education** levels strongly influence acceptance | Reflects awareness & trust in financial products |
| **Families of 3–4 members** are more likely to accept | Suggests mid-life financial planning stage |
| **CD Account holders** are 13× more likely to accept | Clear cross-sell opportunity |
| **Online banking usage** and **credit card status** had minimal predictive value | Marketing focus can deprioritize these factors |



## **6. Business Implications**

| **Strategic Area** | **Business Action** | **Expected Impact** |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Customer Targeting** | Focus marketing campaigns on **educated, high-income families** and **existing CD account holders**. | Increases likelihood of acceptance and overall campaign conversion rate. |
| **Cross-Selling Strategy** | Promote personal loan products to **deposit and CD account holders** with strong financial profiles. | Strengthens customer retention and lifetime value through multi-product engagement. |
| **Operational Efficiency** | *(Future Work)* Deploy the **predictive model in CRM systems** to rank customers by likelihood and **automate campaign targeting** — sending personalized promotional loan offers to high-probability customers. | Streamlines marketing workflows and enables real-time, data-driven decision-making. |
| **Cost Optimization** | Reduce marketing spend on **low-probability segments**, reallocating resources toward **high-ROI prospects** identified by the model. | Improves marketing ROI and reduces acquisition cost per customer. |



## **7. Model Performance Summary**

| **Model** | **Strengths** | **Business Advantage** |
|------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | Interpretable, baseline model | Simple threshold-based marketing rule |
| **Random Forest** | Handles non-linearity | Robust prediction for diverse customer profiles |
| **XGBoost (Best)** | High recall, precision, and AUC | Best balance between accuracy and interpretability for deployment |

**Evaluation Metrics (Example)**  

| **Metric** | **Logistic Regression** | **Random Forest** | **XGBoost** |
|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Accuracy** | 0.88 | 0.91 | **0.93** |
| **Recall** | 0.76 | 0.83 | **0.87** |
| **ROC-AUC** | 0.91 | 0.95 | **0.97** |



## **8. Recommendations**

- **Deploy XGBoost model** in real-time prediction systems (e.g., CRM, marketing automation).  
- Implement **A/B testing** to measure campaign lift with model-based targeting.  
- Continuously update the model using **recent campaign data** to adapt to changing customer behaviors.  
- Use **SHAP-based explanations** in production dashboards to interpret customer-level predictions.  



## **9. Limitations & Future Scope**

| **Aspect** | **Current Limitation** | **Future Improvement** |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Data** | Limited historical depth | Incorporate transaction & credit history |
| **Features** | Missing behavioral signals | Add customer engagement & social media data |
| **Model** | Offline analysis only | Deploy via FastAPI + Docker for real-time inference |
| **Evaluation** | One-time testing | Continuous performance monitoring & retraining |
